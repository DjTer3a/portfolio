As the technology field continues to evolve rapidly, software engineers must stay on top of the latest trends and developments to remain competitive. In this article, I will explore five key insights that will shape the future of software engineering.

## AI & machine learning

The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is becoming
increasingly prevalent in software development. 
These technologies allow for the automation of many tasks, 
such as code testing and debugging, which can save time and 
improve the quality of software. However, one should be careful while using
them as they often produce logic errors, neglect best practices, and 
misunderstand the question leading to misleading code.

## Low-code & No-code tools
The concept of "low-code"/"no-code" development is rising in popularity
, as it allows for the creation of complex and straightforward software applications without 
the need for extensive programming knowledge. This trend will make 
software development more accessible to a broader range of individuals, 
including those with little to no coding experience.

## Cyber Security
The importance of security in the software will continue to grow even more. 
As more and more personal and sensitive data is stored and transmitted 
digitally, software must be designed and built with security 
in mind. This will require software engineers to understand security best practices and technologies strongly. Due to recent events, I have observed
a considerable rise in security exploitation, and the importance of cybersecurity was highlighted.

## Open Source Software
The use of open-source software will continue to expand. 
Not only does open-source software often have a strong community of contributors 
and users, but it can also save organizations money and provide access to a 
wide range of high-quality software components. Recent examples include ChatGPT by OpenAI
while it's not open-source anymore it started as open-source. It is a testament to the power of open-source.

## Collaboration
The field of software engineering will become even more collaborative 
and interconnected. As the lines between different technology disciplines 
continue to blur, software engineers will need to work closely with 
other professionals, such as data scientists and UX designers, to create 
integrated solutions.

Overall, the future of software engineering is bright, 
with exciting new technologies and opportunities on the horizon, despite the recent 
downturn and hiring freezes. By staying up to date with the latest trends and 
developments, software engineers can position themselves for success in this 
rapidly-changing field.
